Absolutely! Here's a **focused list of the most important LeetCode problems that use the Two Pointers technique**, starting from **Easy** to **Hard**, with a short explanation for each.

## âœ… **Easy Two Pointers Problems**

1. **[Reverse String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/)**

   * Swap characters from both ends.
   * Pointers: `left = 0`, `right = n - 1`

2. **[Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/)**

   * Check if a string reads the same forward and backward, ignoring non-alphanumerics.
   * Pointers move inward from both ends.

3. **[Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)**

   * Use slow & fast pointers to overwrite duplicates.

4. **[Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)**

   * Classic two pointer merging.

5. **[Squares of a Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/squares-of-a-sorted-array/)**

   * Use two pointers from both ends to fill the result array in reverse.

## âš¡ **Medium Two Pointers Problems**

6. **[3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)**

   * Fix one number, and use two pointers to find the remaining two.
   * Requires sorting first.

7. **[Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)**

   * Use two pointers to find max area between lines.

8. **[Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)**

   * Move `fast` n steps ahead, then move both until `fast` is null.

9. **[Partition Labels](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-labels/)**

   * Not direct two pointers, but interval merging can be solved with a pointer-like approach.

10. **[Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)**

* Sliding window with two pointers (`left`, `right`), plus a hash set.

11. **[Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/)**

* Dutch National Flag problem using three pointers.

12. **[Move Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)**

* Move non-zero elements forward with slow pointer, fill rest with zeroes.

## ðŸ”¥ **Hard Two Pointers Problems**

13. **[Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)**

* Use two pointers from both ends to calculate trapped water.

14. **[Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/)**

* Sliding window technique using two pointers.

15. **[Sliding Window Maximum](https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/)**

* Advanced sliding window with deque or two pointers.

## ðŸ“š Two Pointers Patterns

| Problem Pattern              | Examples                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Two ends, moving inward      | Reverse String, Palindrome, Container With Most Water      |
| Fast & slow pointer          | Remove Nth Node, Cycle Detection                           |
| Sliding window with hash set | Longest Substring Without Repeat, Minimum Window Substring |
| Duplicate removal            | Remove Duplicates, Move Zeroes                             |

## ðŸ§  Tip to Master

Start with **Reverse String â†’ Valid Palindrome â†’ 3Sum â†’ Container With Most Water â†’ Trapping Rain Water** in this order. That flow builds your logic from basic to complex.
